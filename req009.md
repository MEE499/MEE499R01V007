## Milestones in the project:

 - [x] : 1 Sampling / Hands-On Training
To be able to understand and thus, effectively reproduce the working prototype of communication over a WSN using physical ands emulated boards.

 - [ ] : 2 Use-cases' Derivation
To be able to identify and refactor all (most) general points of loss in susceptibility of sensing and communications.

 - [ ] : 3 Re-Implementaion
To be able to demonstrate the achieved imrovability in current network communication standard among previously un-tethered (Usual cars, 2-Wheelers, Bicycles) within the IoT and the Physical Web, Radio and existing WSN framework.
