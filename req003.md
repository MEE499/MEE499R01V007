## Gaps in the Literature
Most  of  these  projects  use  the  standard  IEEE 802.11 for communication. But also GSM, UMTS, GPRS protocols are used in some of these projects. Generally WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) are deployed uneffectively and thus "platoonong" is inefficient, since the convuluted network is not 'big' enough in terms of the 'no. of nodes' present in the V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) or V2I(Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) network.
Traditionally, IEE standards like the Basic layers have been employed tor the information transmission.
Routing  inside  a  low  power  area  network  (LoWPAN)  might  be considered a  challenge,  as  the RPL has to  work over lossy radio links, with battery-powered nodes, multihop mesh topologies and frecuent topology changes.
To give a solution several working groups are giving support to the RFCâ€™s for this protocol. One of them is the routing over lowpan and lossy networks (ROLL) who is in charge of routing tasks. Meanwhile the "6LoWPAN" is trying to bring the new IPv6 addressing system to these resource-constrained devices.
We try to predict the points of failure in such technology from a penetration and security testing point of view and conlclude with instantly applicable remedies via pull requests to the FOSS code repositories.
