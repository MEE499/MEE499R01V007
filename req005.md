## Objectives:

 - [ ] : To come up with a neat-networking protocol schema to address inefficient hop-on /ad-hoc communication propogation delays, possibly trying to implement in a decentralized contract.

 - [ ] : To be able to successfully reproduce the hardware based real-time implementation of the AGL release on an ARM based development board.

 - [ ] : To provide an future roadmap for Non-hybrid cum Hybrid on-road network integration in a cheap (feasible), environment-friendly (sustainanble) and energy-efficient (if not, utilitarian) by means of a snap-on dashboard powered by a simple smartphones' sensors, transmitters and transduecers.

 - [ ] : To demonstrate a successful implementation of AGL (improvised fork) during the final review.
